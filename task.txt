**The application should have the following features:**

1. User Authentication:
    - Implement signup and login functionality using email and password
    - Ensure secure password storage and user session management
2. Task Board:
    - Upon logging in, users should see their personal task board
    - The board should have four columns: "To-Do", "In Progress", “Under Review” and "Completed"
3. Task Management:
    - Users can create new tasks in any column
    - Each task should have
        - A title (mandatory)
        - A description (not mandatory to fill)
        - Status (mandatory)
            - Automatically fill if card created from buttons in specific section
        - Priority (not mandatory)
            - Values for priority - Low, Medium, Urgent
        - Deadline (not mandatory
    - Users can edit and delete tasks after creation
4. Drag and Drop Functionality:
    - Implement drag and drop feature to move tasks between columns
    - The task's status should update automatically when moved to a different column
5. Data Persistence:
    - All user data (account information and tasks) must be stored in a database

    //flow : page.tsx => conatins the main program code 

    //first figure out the routing 
    //create dynamic routes -> exameple : for a specific user id create a route 
    //how can you create a dynamic route ? 
    //next has this property of using [] to create a dynamic route 
    //whatever is dynamic should go inside that part 
    //ex: id => dynamic route 
    //how to fetch this id ?
    every page inside the app folder is a server component 
    //server component has some special features like you can access the params 
//every folder we create inside the next 13 will become a route 
app -> (test) => you cant access this through url , will give 404 code 
app -> (test) -> something => you can access this through url

so what is the use of (test) => since there are many routes in our project and we want to group
them under one hood/folder we use (test) , which is not accesible through url
create a layout.tsx file inside the (user) 
now (user) contains many subfolders (other) / (something)
//to access the url by specifying these keywords we use this method

//layout.tsx create layouts for specific routes inside the (user) folder
//like if we want a navabr component across all our routes we can use this concept 
app -> (test) -> specify the navbar component -> {children} => navbar component will be present in all these routes
so this is how we can seprate reuse our components in the project 
//we have deleted the folders , this was used for just explanation 

yout main layout would be 

navabr 

children 

footer 


we are using shadcn-ui for creating buttons => all the components will be insdie the components folder


think in terms of reusable components npw 
keep a ui folder for all the shadcn ui components 
and all the assests would be in public folder 

create a reusable component for logo

__componets : this is a folder which is completely inaccessible 
even if we create a file page.tsx inside it 
//it wont be accessible through url unless we import in into the page 
//our logo will redirect us to our page


to change the favicon , make the changes inside the main layout 

AUTHENTICATION : we will be using clerk for auth 
//install clerk
give all the permission 
copy the env variables and paste them in .env file 
//go to gitignore and add .env so that it does not get committed to github

create another file (platform) and there use <ClerkProvider></ClerkProvider>

//now create a middleware 
create a new file middleware.ts and update details there

//look at the documentation and update all the necessary changes 


after all the setting up of /sign-in & /sign-up
update the middleware routes 

NOTE: if we are dealing with client side components we will be requiring hooks 
so everything we have to destructure it 


now i want that as soon as i login i want to redirect to the main dashboard with my name
